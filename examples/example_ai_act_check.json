AI System Classification\nBased on our current assessment, legup.dev does not deploy or operate AI systems as defined under the EU AI Act. Our platform operates as a standard web application without automated decision-making, machine learning models, or artificial intelligence capabilities that would trigger AI Act obligations.\n\n2. No AI Systems Declaration\nWe confirm that:\n• Our platform does not utilize AI systems for user interactions\n• No automated decision-making processes are implemented\n• No machine learning algorithms process user data\n• No AI-generated content is produced or displayed to users\n\n3. Third-Party AI Services\nWhile our core platform does not employ AI systems, we may utilize third-party services that incorporate AI technologies for infrastructure, analytics, or operational purposes. Any such usage:\n• Operates transparently within our existing Privacy Policy framework\n• Does not involve user-facing AI interactions\n• Remains subject to our standard data processing agreements\n\n4. Monitoring and Updates\nWe continuously monitor our technical infrastructure and service offerings to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable AI regulations. Should we implement AI systems in the future, we will:\n• Conduct appropriate risk assessments under the EU AI Act\n• Implement required transparency measures\n• Update this Compliance Statement accordingly\n• Notify users of any changes to our AI capabilities\n\n5. Risk Management Framework\nAlthough we do not currently operate AI systems, we maintain awareness of AI Act requirements including:\n• Risk categorization methodologies (prohibited, high-risk, limited-risk, minimal-risk)\n• Conformity assessment procedures\n• Quality management system requirements\n• Documentation and record-keeping obligations\n\n6. User Rights and Transparency\nIn the event we introduce AI systems, users will be informed of:\n• The presence and nature of AI interactions\n• The purpose and functionality of AI systems\n• Any automated decision-making processes\n• Rights regarding AI-driven decisions\n\n7. Compliance Verification\nThis Compliance Statement reflects our current operational status. We conduct regular reviews to ensure accuracy and will update this document as our services evolve or as AI Act guidance develops.\n\n8. Contact Information\nFor questions regarding our AI Act compliance or this statement, please contact us:\n• Email: vtxyzz@gmail.com\n• Company: Vasile Tiple / LegUp\n• Jurisdiction: Romanian law, Courts of Bucharest\n\n9.
